## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Permission Check

```javascript
import { useAuth } from './components/Auth/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { hasPermission } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {hasPermission('manage_bookings') && (
        <button>Create Booking</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Protected Route

```javascript
<Route path="/admin" element={
  <ProtectedRoute permission="view_admin_panel">
    <AdminPanel />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Service Usage

```javascript
import { agentService, creditService } from './services';

// Only admin can call this
const agents = await agentService.getAllAgents();

// Only agents can call this  
const balance = await creditService.getCreditBalance();
```

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: User selects role and logs in
2. **Token Storage**: Access/refresh tokens stored securely
3. **Permission Loading**: User permissions loaded based on role
4. **Route Access**: Routes filtered by permissions
5. **API Calls**: All requests include auth headers
6. **Token Refresh**: Automatic renewal when needed
7. **Logout**: Clean token removal and redirect
